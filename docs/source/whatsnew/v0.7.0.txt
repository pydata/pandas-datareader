Backwards incompatible API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Deprecation of Google finance daily reader.  Google retired the remaining financial data end point in June 2018.  It is not possible to reliably retrieve historical price data without this endpoint. The Google daily reader will raise an `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.
- Deprecation of Morningstar daily reader. Morningstar ended support for the historical price data endpoint in July 2018. It is not possible to retrieve historical price data without this endpoint. The Morningstar daily reader will raise an `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.
- When requesting multiple symbols from a DailyReader (ex: google, yahoo, IEX)
  a MultiIndex DataFrame is now returned.  Previously Panel or dict of DataFrames
  were returned. (:issue:`297`).
