.. _whatsnew_060:

v0.6.0 (January 23, 2018)
---------------------------

This is a major release from 0.5.0. We recommend that all users upgrade.

.. warning::

  Yahoo!, Google Options, Google Quotes and EDGAR have been immediately
  deprecated.

.. note::

  Google finance is still functioning for historical price data,
  although there are frequent reports of failures.  Failure is frequently
  encountered when bulk downloading historical price data.

Highlights include:

- Immediate deprecation of Yahoo!, Google Options and Quotes and EDGAR. The
  end points behind these APIs have radically changed and the existing readers
  require complete rewrites. In the case of most Yahoo! data the endpoints
  have been removed.  PDR would like to restore these features, and pull
  requests are welcome.

- A new connector for IEX daily price data was introduced (:issue:`465`).

- A new connector for IEX the majority of the IEX API was introduced
  (:issue:`446`).

- A new data connector for stock index data provided by Stooq was
  introduced (:issue:`447`).

- A new data connector for data provided by the Bank of Canada was
  introduced (:issue:`440`).

.. _whatsnew_060.api_breaking:

Backwards incompatible API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Deprecation of Yahoo readers.  Yahoo! retired the financial data end points in
  late 2017.  It is not possible to reliably retrieve data from Yahoo! without
  these endpoints. The Yahoo! readers have been immediately deprecated and
  will raise an `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.

- Deprecation of EDGAR readers. EDGAR substantially altered their API. The EDGAR
  readers have been immediately deprecated and will raise an
  `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.

- Google finance data will raise an `UnstableAPIWarning` when first called.
  Google has also altered their API in a way that makes reading data
  unreliable.  It many call it works.  However it also regularly fails,
  especially when used for bulk downloading. Google may be removed in the
  future.
